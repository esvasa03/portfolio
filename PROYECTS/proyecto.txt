Proyects:

1) Raising Talents

With the KNN machine learning model, we seek to find the researchers with the greatest potential within Tec de Monterrey.

2) RB diagnosis

With the machine learning model of Bayesian networks, a diagnosis of different patients was made

3) Image compression

It is a work that uses PCA to decrease the dimensionality of an image.

4) European Option Challenge:

Through stochastic optimization models, we sought to model the behavior of the Amazon stock, as well as using the Black Scholes model to analyze the price of European options.
